Intelligent Chinese Chess
=============================


>Course project for Data Structure and Algorithm. Project2.

### Overview
A Chinese Chess game implemented with artificial intelligence, rendered in Java 2D. Supports human-computer competition.

The project is written in Java. You are supposed to run ‘ChineseChess.java’ in Intellij IDEA, instead of Eclipse. The project is open sourced on [Github](https://github.com/geeeeeeeeek/IntelligentChineseChessSystem/).

The intelligence and implementation of this algorithm is relatively naive. In a rough test, it has 50% winning chance to defeat a human play with previous winning rate of 1.5:1. It fails to compete with complicated Artificial Intelligence. So, don't take my implementation seriously.
